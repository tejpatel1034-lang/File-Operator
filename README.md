# Personal Journal Manager
This is a Personal Journal Manager project made using Python.
The main purpose of this project is to help users write, store, search, and delete their daily journal entries using a simple command-line program.

Instead of writing journals in a notebook, this program saves everything in a text file so that entries are safe and can be accessed anytime.

This project is useful for beginners who want to practice file handling, loops, functions, and Python modules.

# Features
1. Add New Journal Entry

    User can write a journal entry, and the program automatically saves it with the current date and time.

 2. View All Entries

    User can view all saved journal entries from the file.

 3. Search Journal Entries

    User can search entries using a keyword or date.
    If the keyword matches, the related journal entry will be displayed.

 4. Delete All Entries

    User can delete all journal entries at once.
    The program asks for confirmation before deleting.

5. Exit Program

   User can safely exit the program anytime.

# Concepts Used
 - This project uses many important Python concepts:

 - File Handling (open(), read, write, append)

 - Python Modules (os, datetime)

 - Functions

 - Loops (while)

 - Conditional Statements

 - match-case statement
